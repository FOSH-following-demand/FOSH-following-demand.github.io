#### Preliminary survey results are in! Here are the most needed tools (16/04/2019):

optical microscope  
thermocycler  
electrophysiology system  
centrifuge  
sequencer  
hplc  
spectrophotometer  
fluorescence microscope  
confocal microscope  
2-photon microscope  
incubator  
behavioural setup  
real time thermocycler  
mass spectrometer  
liquid handling robot  
gas chromatography system  
plate reader  
electron microscope  
freezer  
cytometer  
transilluminator

Luckly, there are already several online projects
documenting open versions of these tools. Now it is on to phase 2 of this project to contribute with the existing projects and bring them forward!
