#### Currently we are tackling these issues (below) and all help and suggestions are welcome!


#### Issues for the website itself:
- We want to reach as many people as possible! Therefore we would like to translate the website to as many different languages as we can:
 - Spanish
 - German
 - Italian
 - French
 - ~~Portuguese~~ *Done!*

 - Is your language not listed here?  - No worries!
   - If you would like to translate it to your language and you are familiar with Git systems, just fork this repo, translate the pages in a separate folder and make a pull request. If you are not familiar, drop us a line! we can get you up and going in no time! andremaia[at]mozillafoundation.org

#### Issues around the survey:
- Similar to the website, we want the survey to be taken by many people, therefore we are looking for collaborators to translate it to different languages!
