### Hi! welcome to the landing page of our project!

<br>




#### Our main goal is to increase access to science and education by making their tools (think laboratory equipment) open source!

<br>

####  Our first step is to conduct [online surveys](bit.ly/BFOSH) to learn what researchers, educators, DIYers and curious people need/miss in their work places to conduct their scientific experiments.

<br>


#### - Here is the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FOSH-following-demand/projects/2) showing where we want to go.    

#### - To read more details about the project, [click here](https://fosh-following-demand.github.io/en/about)
