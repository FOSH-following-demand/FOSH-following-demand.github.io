## Hi! welcome to the home of the Build FOSH following demand project.


<br>

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are conducting an online survey to learn what researchers, educators, DIYers and curious people need/miss in their work places to conduct their scientific experiments. This is the first part of a longer project to develop open source tools for science and education.

- #### Here is the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FOSH-following-demand/projects/2) showing where we want to go.
