## Hi! welcome to the landing page of our project!

### Our main goal is to increase access to science and education by making their tools (think laboratory equipment) open souce!

<br>

####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first step is to conduct online surveys to learn what researchers, educators, DIYers and curious people need/miss in their work places to conduct their scientific experiments.

<br>

- Here is the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FOSH-following-demand/projects/2) showing where we want to go.
